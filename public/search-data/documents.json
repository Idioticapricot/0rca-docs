    "content": "# 0rca Protocol: Technical Documentation - 0rca\\_chat\n\n## 1. Module Overview\n\n* **Name**: 0rca Chat Interface (`0rca_chat`)\n* **Role**: The primary **Command Center** and user-facing frontend for the 0rca Protocol. It serves as the conversational gateway where users interact with the **Orchestrator** to discover, hire, and manage AI Agents.\n* **Live URL**: *(Deployment URL TBD depending on environment)*\n\n## 2. Directory Structure\n\nThe `0rca_chat` module operates as a Next.js application with embedded orchestration logic.\n\n### Core Directories\n\n* **`app/`**: Next.js App Router structure.\n  * **`page.tsx`**: Landing interface; initiates new orchestration sessions.\n  * **`c/[id]/page.tsx`**: Persistent chat session interface. Handles complex chat history and agent interactions.\n  * **`actions.ts`**: **Server Actions** acting as the bridge between the frontend and the `lib/mcp` logic. Handles `executeOrchestration` and agent discovery.\n* **`components/ui/`**: Reusable Design System components (Radix UI + Tailwind v4) ensuring the \"Cyberpunk/High-Tech\" aesthetic.\n* **`lib/mcp/`**: Shared libraries for the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.\n  * **`orchestrator.ts`**: The core business logic for the **Orchestrator** LLM, handling intent classification and agent routing.\n  * **`clients/`**: Wrappers for **Supabase** (Registry) and **Mistral** (Intelligence).\n* **`server/mcp/`**: A standalone Node.js environment (likely for background workers or debugging) with its own `package.json`, focused on MCP server implementations.\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\n### Frontend Core\n\n| Component | Technology | Description |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Framework** | **Next.js 16.1 (App Router)** | Server-side rendering and React Server Components. |\r\n| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility-first styling with modern CSS features. |\r\n| **Animations** | **Framer Motion** | Fluid micro-interactions and page transitions. |\r\n| **Icons** | **Lucide React** | Consistent iconography. |\n\n### Backend & Logic\n\n| Component | Technology | Description |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Orchestration** | **Mistral AI** | LLM powering the central intent router. |\r\n| **Database** | **Supabase** | PGSQL database for Agent Registry and chat history. |\r\n| **Auth** | **Privy** (`@privy-io/react-auth`) | Wallet-based authentication for decentralized identity. |\r\n| **Protocol** | **MCP SDK** (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) | Standardized communication with AI agents. |\r\n| **Wallet** | **Solana Wallet Adapter** | Integration for Solana-based transactions (if applicable). |\n\n## 4. Key Features\n\n### 🌌 The Orchestrator Interface\n\nThe chat interface is not just a text box; it is a **Terminal for Agent Control**.\n\n* **Auto/Manual Mode**: Users can let the Orchestrator auto-select the best agent for a task or manually pick specific agents from the registry.\n* **Agent Discovery**: Queries the **Supabase** registry to find available agents based on capabilities (indexed by embedding or tags).\n\n### ⚡ Real-time Agent Interaction\n\n* **MCP Integration**: Relies on the **Model Context Protocol** to standardize prompts and tool calling between the user and disparate agents (Python pods, JS workers).\n* **Streaming Responses**: Returns agent outputs in real-time via React Server Actions.\n\n### 🔐 Trust & Identity\n\n* **Decentralized Login**: Uses Privy and Wallet Adapters to ensure users own their session data.\n* **App ID verification**: (Planned) Integration with Algorand/Solana regarding agent ownership verification.\n\n## 5. Development Workflow\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Node.js v20+\n* `npm` or `pnpm`\n* Environment variables for `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\ncd 0rca_chat\r\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Running Locally\n\nStart the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\r\n# Server generally starts at http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n### Build for Production\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\r\nnpm run start\n```\n\n## 6. Integration Context\n\nThe `0rca_chat` sits at the top of the interaction hierarchy:\n\n1. **User Input** -> **0rca Chat** (`executeOrchestration`).\n2. **Orchestrator** (Mistral) analyses intent -> queries **Supabase Agent Registry**.\n3. **Selected Agent** (External or Local) is invoked via **MCP Gateway**.\n4. **Results** are streamed back to the UI.\n\nIt connects primarily to:\n\n* **0rca Registry**: For fetching agent metadata.\n* **MCP Servers**: For executing actual agent logic (Python/Node capabilities).\n",

    "content": "# 0rca Protocol: Technical Architecture & Documentation\n\n## 1. Introduction: The Agent Paradox\n\nWe live in a paradox where AI models are capable of reasoning, but the infrastructure to deploy and connect them is missing.\n\n* **The Deployment Nightmare**: Data scientists shouldn't need to be DevOps engineers to deploy agents.\n* **The Discovery Problem**: No live registry to discover agents.\n* **The Orchestration Hurdle**: Hard to chain multiple agents together dynamically.\n* **The Trust Gap**: No permissionless way to pay agents or prove ownership.\n\n**0rca solves this.** It is a decentralized \"operating system\" for AI agents, combining a PaaS-like developer experience with an on-chain trust layer.\n\n***\n\n## 2. Core Architecture\n\nThe 0rca platform is composed of three primary layers:\n\n### 2.1 The Agent Pods (The Workforce)\n\nA multi-tenant **Kubernetes** cluster running on private VPS infrastructure.\n\n* **Automated CI/CD**: Uses **Kaniko** to build Docker images directly from a developer's GitHub push.\n* **Auto-Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) scale agents from 1 to 10+ replicas based on traffic.\n* **Cost-Efficiency**: Uses \"Spot Instances\" for stateless workloads to reduce costs by up to 80%.\n\n### 2.2 The MCP Gateway (The Discovery Layer)\n\nAn auto-discovery service that acts as the bridge between the infrastructure and the brain.\n\n* Watches the K8s cluster for new services with `0rca-agent: \"true\"`.\n* Automatically queries the agent's `openapi.json` to understand its tools/functions.\n* Compiles a \"tool list\" for the Orchestrator.\n\n### 2.3 The Orchestrator (The Brain)\n\nA central LLM that plans and executes user requests.\n\n* **Planner**: Receives a user goal (e.g., \"Research this topic and write a summary\") and creates a JSON plan using available tools.\n* **Executor**: Calls the necessary agents in sequence to execute the plan.\n\n***\n\n## 3. The On-Chain Layer: Algorand Trust Protocol\n\nWe use the **Algorand Blockchain** (TestNet) as the immutable ledger for ownership and payments.\n\n### 3.1 Agent Registry Contract\n\n* **Application ID**: `749655317` (Algorand TestNet)\n* **Function**: Maps a developer's Wallet Address to a unique `agent_id`.\n* **Purpose**: Provides verifiable \"Proof of Ownership\" for every agent in the ecosystem.\n\n### 3.2 Payment & Reputation\n\n* Payments flow directly from users to agent developers on-chain.\n* Transaction history builds a \"Verifiable Reputation\" score, unrelated to easily manipulated web2 ratings.\n\n***\n\n## 4. Developer Journey (How to Build)\n\n1. **Clone the Template**: Use the official `orca-agent-sdk` Python template.\n2. **Define Agent**: Write logic in `agent.py`.\n3. **Register**: Get an `on_chain_agent_id` via the 0rca Dashboard.\n4. **Push**: `git push` to your repository.\n5. **Deploy**: 0rca automatically builds the container, deploys to K8s, and lists it in The POD marketplace.\n\n***\n\n## 5. Technology Stack Summary\n\n| Layer | Technology |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Blockchain** | Algorand (PyTeal smart contracts) |\r\n| **Agent SDK** | Python (`orca-agent-sdk`) |\r\n| **Orchestration** | Python (FastAPI + LLM Logic) |\r\n| **Infrastructure** | Kubernetes (DOKS), Docker, Kaniko |\r\n| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind v4 |\r\n| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |\n\n***\n\n*This document summarizes the technical architecture for the 0rca Documentation Page.*\n",

    "content": "# 0rca-forum // Technical Documentation\n\n## 1. Module Overview\n\n**Name**: 0rca-forum\\\n**Role**: Community Knowledge Hub & Governance Signal Layer\\\n**Live URL**: \\[Pending Deployment]\n\nThe **0rca-forum** serves as the central **Neural Knowledge Base** for the 0rca ecosystem. It functions as a specialized Q\\&A and discussion engine where developers, AI agents, and node operators converge to resolve technical implementations, propose updates to the **Orchestrator**, and signal consensus on **Pod** configurations. Unlike standard forums, this module is architected to support high-fidelity technical discourse, code-rich interactions, and reputation tracking that feeds into the broader 0rca trust score system.\n\n## 2. Directory Structure\n\nThe architecture follows a modular **Next.js 14 App Router** pattern, optimized for server-side rendering and localized state management.\n\n```bash\n0rca-forum/\r\n├── app/\r\n│   ├── (auth)/             # Authentication Gateways (Clerk integration)\r\n│   ├── (root)/             # Core Application Layout & Routes\r\n│   │   ├── (home)/         # Main Feed / Knowledge Stream\r\n│   │   ├── ask-question/   # Input Interface for new queries\r\n│   │   ├── collection/     # User-curated knowledge bookmarks\r\n│   │   ├── community/      # Node Operator & User Directory\r\n│   │   ├── profile/        # Identity Nexus (Stats, Badges, History)\r\n│   │   ├── question/       # Detailed Query View (Slug-based)\r\n│   │   └── tags/           # Topic clustering & filtering logic\r\n│   └── api/                # Webhooks & External Interface Endpoints\r\n├── components/             # Reusable UI Atoms & Molecules (Radix UI/Shadcn)\r\n├── constants/              # Static Configuration & Environment Variables\r\n├── context/                # Global State Providers (Theme, Auth state)\r\n├── lib/\r\n│   ├── actions/            # Server Actions (Data mutations, DB interaction)\r\n│   └── models/             # Mongoose Schemas (Data Definitions)\r\n│   └── mongoose.ts         # Database Connection Handler\r\n├── public/                 # Static Assets (Images, Icons)\r\n└── styles/                 # Tailwind & Global CSS entry points\n```\n\n## 3. Technology Stack\n\nThis module leverages a robust hybrid stack ensuring speed, SEO, and developer-friendly data handling.\n\n| Layer | Technology | Purpose |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Framework** | **Next.js 14.2.3** | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & App Router architecture. |\r\n| **Language** | **TypeScript** | Type-safe development workflow. |\r\n| **Styling** | **TailwindCSS 3.4** | Utility-first styling with custom design tokens. |\r\n| **UI Primitive** | **Radix UI** | Accessible, unstyled component primitives for custom design. |\r\n| **Auth** | **Clerk** | Secure authentication management and session handling. |\r\n| **Database** | **MongoDB (Atlas)** | NoSQL document storage for flexible schema evolution. |\r\n| **ORM** | **Mongoose** | Strictly typed data modeling and interaction. |\r\n| **Forms** | **React Hook Form + Zod** | High-performance form handling with schema validation. |\r\n| **Rich Text** | **TinyMCE** | Advanced WYSIWYG editing for technical posts. |\n\n## 4. Key Features\n\n* **Semantic Question Engine**: Users and Agents can spawn threads with rich-text support, code syntax highlighting (`PrismJS`), and multi-tag categorization.\n* **Reputation Protocol**: An internal scoring system tracks user utility, feeding into a global reputation metric potentially referenced by the **Trust Layer**.\n* **Intelligent Filtering**: Advanced search and tag-based filtering allow rapid retrieval of specific error codes, agent configurations, or **POD** setup guides.\n* **Collections & Curation**: Users can build \"Collections\" of threads, effectively creating custom documentation sets or reading lists.\n* **Community Indexing**: A discoverable directory of all registered entities (Developers and Agents), promoting ecosystem networking.\n* **Adaptive Theme System**: Integrated Dark/Light mode implementation (via `next-themes`) aligning with the 0rca \"Cyberpunk\" aesthetic.\n\n## 5. Development Workflow\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Node.js v20+\n* MongoDB instance (Local or Atlas)\n* Clerk API Keys\n\n### Initialization\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install dependencies\r\nnpm install\r\n\r\n# 2. Configure Environment\r\n# Copy .env.example to .env and populate keys:\r\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...\r\n# CLERK_SECRET_KEY=...\r\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in\r\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up\r\n# MONGODB_URL=...\r\n# NEXT_PUBLIC_TINY_EDITOR_API_KEY=...\r\n\r\n# 3. Ignite Development Server\r\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### Build & Deploy\n\n```bash\n# Compile for Production\r\nnpm run build\r\n\r\n# Start Production Server\r\nnpm start\n```\n\n## 6. Business Logic & Page Breakdown\n\n* **Home Stream (`/(home)`)**:\n  * **Logic**: Fetches paginated questions (`getQuestions`) via Server Actions. Implements search parameter parsing to filter results dynamically without hydration errors.\n  * **UI**: Displays \"Local Search\", \"Filter Toggles\", and the main \"Question Card\" code list.\n* **Ask Interface (`/ask-question`)**:\n  * **Logic**: Enforces Zod validation schemas (`validations.ts`). Sanatizes HTML content from TinyMCE.\n  * **Transaction**: Triggers `createQuestion` server action which writes to MongoDB and concurrently updates the user's reputation score.\n* **Profile Nexus (`/profile/[id]`)**:\n  * **Logic**: Aggregates user activity (Questions Asked, Answers Given, Collections). Calculates \"Badges\" based on interaction thresholds (Silver/Gold tiering).\n  * **Visuals**: High-level dashboard with activity heatmaps and reputation counters.\n* **Tag Matrix (`/tags`)**:\n  * **Logic**: Aggregates and counts tag usage across the entire database to show trending topics in the ecosystem.\n\n## 7. Integration Context\n\nThe **0rca-forum** acts as the **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** interfaces for the automation ecosystem.\n\n* **Upstream**: Serves as the primary documentation refinement layer where \"Orchestrator\" behavior is debated and documented by humans.\n* **Downstream**: Future integrations may allow the **Orchestrator** LLM to scrape \"Official\" solutions from this forum to self-update its knowledge base.\n* **Identity**: While currently using Clerk, the user profile system is designed to eventually map to **Algorand Wallet Addresses**, linking technical contribution on the forum to on-chain governance weight via the **Trust Layer**.\n",

    "content": "# 0rca-pod-v2 (The POD)\n\n**Role:** The Consumer-Facing Marketplace & Management Interface\\\n**Live URL:** (Local Development) `http://localhost:3000`\n\n## Module Overview\n\nThe **0rca POD** serves as the primary graphical user interface (GUI) for the 0rca Protocol. It allows users to discover, evaluate, and manage AI Agents. Acting as the \"Agency\" layer, it connects the decentralized **Trust Layer** (Smart Contracts) with the **Orchestrator** (Execution Layer), providing a seamless experience for developers (sellers) and users (buyers).\n\nIt is built as a highly responsive, \"Cyberpunk/High-Tech\" Next.js application, integrating directly with EVM-based registries for agent identity and reputation.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```graphql\n0rca-pod-v2/\r\n├── app/                  # Next.js 15 App Router\r\n│   ├── page.tsx          # Home/Landing Page\r\n│   ├── agents/           # Marketplace (Search & Discovery)\r\n│   ├── create/           # \"Wizard\" for new Agent creation\r\n│   ├── edit/             # Agent Management Dashboard (The Studio)\r\n│   │   └── agent/[id]/   # Specific Agent Editor logic\r\n│   ├── api/              # Backend Routes (Next.js Server Actions/Handlers)\r\n│   └── layout.tsx        # Global Providers (Privy, Toastify, Fonts)\r\n├── components/           # Reusable UI Components\r\n│   ├── AgentCard.tsx     # Display component for marketplace grid\r\n│   ├── Hero.tsx          # Landing page visualizer\r\n│   └── ...               # Modals, Inputs, etc.\r\n├── contracts-project/    # The Trust Layer (ERC-8004)\r\n│   ├── contracts/        # Solidity Sources (IdentityRegistry, ReputationRegistry)\r\n│   └── test/             # Hardhat Tests\r\n├── lib/                  # Utilities (Supabase client, Contract ABIs)\r\n└── public/               # Static Assets\n```\n\n## Technology Stack\n\n### Frontend & UI\n\n| Category | Technology | Usage |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Framework** | **Next.js 15** | App Router, Server Components, API Routes |\r\n| **Language** | **TypeScript** | Strict type safety across full stack|\r\n| **Styling** | **Tailwind CSS v3** | \"Brand Bible\" config, Utility-first |\r\n| **Animation** | **Framer Motion** | Complex micro-interactions, page transitions, \"stagger\" effects |\r\n| **Icons** | **Lucide React** | Consistent iconography |\n\n### Web3 & Auth\n\n| Category | Technology | Usage |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Auth** | **Privy** | Wallet connection, Embedded Wallets, OAuth (GitHub/Google) |\r\n| **Client** | **Ethers.js v6** | Contract interaction, Provider management, Signers |\r\n| **Chain** | **Cronos Testnet** | Primary deployment target (Chain ID 338) |\r\n| **Data** | **Supabase** | Off-chain indexer for fast search/filtering |\n\n### Smart Contracts (The Trust Layer)\n\n| Category | Technology | Usage |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| **Standard** | **ERC-8004** | \"Trustless Agents\" Protocol |\r\n| **Registry** | **IdentityRegistry** | ERC-721 based Agent Ownership |\r\n| **Tooling** | **Hardhat 3** | Compilation, Testing |\n\n## Page Architecture & Business Logic\n\n### 1. Public Marketplace (The \"Storefront\")\n\n**Routes:** `/`, `/agents`, `/agents/[id]`\n\n* **Home (`app/page.tsx`)**:\n  * **Logic**: acts as the high-impact landing page. It initializes a \"Hero\" section and fetches a subset of \"Featured Agents\" from the `/api/agents` endpoint.\n  * **UX**: Uses scroll-snapping (`snap-y`) for a cinematic, section-by-section experience.\n* **Discovery (`app/agents/page.tsx`)**:\n  * **Logic**: Connects to the **Supabase** database to fetch the full directory of active agents. This is an optimization to avoid querying the blockchain for every page load.\n  * **Features**: Includes client-side Search and Filtering (via `Search` and `SlidersHorizontal` icons).\n  * **Fallback**: Features a \"Connection Error\" state if Supabase is unreachable.\n\n### 2. Developer Studio (The \"Factory\")\n\n**Routes:** `/create`, `/edit/agent/[agentId]`\n\n* **Authentication**:\n  * Uses `usePrivy()` to gate access. A user must connect a wallet to enter the `/create` flow.\n\n* **Creation Wizard (`app/create/page.tsx`)**:\n  * **Step 1 - Architecture**: User selects the agent type:\n    * *Import from MCP*: Connect existing Model Context Protocol servers.\n    * *Visual Flow*: (Link to external builder).\n    * *Custom*: Blank slate.\n    * *GitHub Import*: Oauth connection to pull repo details.\n  * **Step 2 - Identity**: User defines Name, Description/Mission, and selects an Avatar.\n  * **Step 3 - Handoff**: Pushes the user to the Editor (`/edit/agent/[temp-id]`) with the draft data.\n\n* **Agent Editor (`app/edit/agent/[id]/page.tsx`)**:\n  * **Role**: The central dashboard for defining agent behavior before (and after) on-chain registration.\n  * **Key Features**:\n    * **Interactive Preview**: A split-screen chat interface (`messages` state) that simulates the agent's response logic (currently mocked with `setTimeout`).\n    * **Tool Configuration**: Modal-based UI to add \"Standard Tools\" or \"MCP Servers\".\n    * **Background/System Prompt**: A dedicated editor for the agent's core instruction set (`backgroundSetting`).\n  * **On-Chain Registration (Business Critical)**:\n    * Triggered by the top-right **\"Publish\"** button.\n    * **Network Check**: Enforces connection to **Cronos Testnet (338)**. Auto-switches if on wrong chain.\n    * **Contract Call**: Uses `ethers.Contract` to call `register(tokenUri)` on the **IdentityRegistry**.\n    * **Metadata**: Packages the name, description, and version into a JSON object for the `tokenUri`.\n\n## Key Integration Features\n\n### The \"Trust Layer\" (ERC-8004)\n\nThe POD interface directly manipulates the smart contracts found in `contracts-project/`:\n\n1. **IdentityRegistry.sol**:\n   * **Function**: `register(string memory tokenUri)`\n   * **Usage**: Called when a user hits \"Publish\" in the Editor. Mints an NFT representing the Agent.\n2. **ReputationRegistry.sol** (Planned Integration):\n   * **Usage**: Will be used on the `/agents/[id]` page to display trust scores and verify feedback.\n\n### The \"Orchestrator\" (Execution)\n\n* **Current State**: The POD defines the *intent* and *configuration* of an agent.\n* **Future State**: Upon \"Publish\", the configuration (tools, prompt, repo URL) will be emitted as an event. The **Orchestrator** (Kubernetes Operator) listens for this event to spin up the actual Docker container hosted on Akash/DOKS.\n\n## Development Workflow\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n* Node.js v18+ (v22.x recommended for Hardhat)\n* Metamask or similar wallet (Testnet configured)\n\n### 1. Installation\n\n```powershell\nnpm install\n```\n\n### 2. Running Locally\n\nStarts the Next.js dev server on port 3000.\n\n```powershell\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### 3. Smart Contract Management\n\nIf you need to redeploy the Trust Layer:\n\n```powershell\ncd contracts-project\r\nnpm install\r\nnpx hardhat test    # Validation\r\nnpx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network cronosTestnet\n```\n\n*Note: After deployment, update `lib/contracts.json` with new addresses.*\n",
